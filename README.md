# Tic Tac Toe 

### Installing GHC 
Stack will install the correct version of GHC for our project. This is cool because everyone working on your project will be on the same version. Letâ€™s give it a shot: run this in your project folder
```
$ stack setup
```
Which results in:
```
Downloaded lts-3.1 build plan.    
Caching build plan
Fetched package index.
Populated index cache.
Downloaded ghc-7.10.2.
Installed GHC.
stack will use a locally installed GHC
For more information on paths, see 'stack path' and 'stack exec env'
To use this GHC and packages outside of a project, consider using:
stack ghc, stack ghci, stack runghc, or stack exec
```

### Usage 

```
$ stack ghci
Configuring GHCi with the following packages: my-project
GHCi, version 7.10.2: http://www.haskell.org/ghc/  :? for help
Prelude>
```

Load the main module : 
```
Prelude> :load Main
[1 of 1] Compiling Main             ( src/Main.hs, interpreted )
Ok, modules loaded: Main.
```

Run the program by typing `main`: 
```
Main> main
hello world
```
